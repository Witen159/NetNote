- Planning: Set a deadline for functionality mutually agreed on, keep to the deadline. Everyone good with working on weekends. Saturdays are deadlines for merge requests. Current minute taker posts on Brightspace. Saturday 16.00 is the deadline for merge requests. Then 20.00 is deadline for reviews and merge approvals.
- Communication: We have a whatsapp group. Make a discord group. Use mattermost for discussions with TA.
- Outside collaboration: Mandatory meeting on Wednesday with TA at 15.45, and optional meeting during the labs starting at 13.45. Full team meetings over discord. Other meetings arranged when needed. Explaining why we missed another meeting except from the joker. Discord meet at 14.00 every Monday for task split (aprox. 20 minutes/max one hour)
- Work quality: Agree on the checkstyle rules, correct description on commits, checking for tests.
- Decision-making: By consensus.
- Broken agreements: First, reach out throughout chats, then if nothing changes approach personally. Worst case scenario reach out to the TA.
- Problem resolution: Call them. If you know in advance, announce. In case of disagreements, work it out, in extreme cases, again, call out to the TA.

What we are currently doing is good. We can have a shorter meeting
And we can discuss and distrubute the task on the mondays.

### 3. Planning upcoming weeks

- Noah Verzaal: Will work on the tests for the collections services.
- Denis Bespalov: Will work on user feedback.
- Felicia Ang: Will work on connecting the client to the server.
- Benny Huang: Will work on bugs and embedded files.
- Alexandra Gâlmeanu: Will work on tags with filter bar.
- Cristian Călin: Will work on the tests for the note services.

**Are the task too big?/Do we need help for specific part of the application?**
- Benny wants to split the feature embedded files into two parts.
- Felicia wants more help in the server side of the application. Since she wants to know how it really works.
- Alex wants to understand the markdown better.

**Will we work in the Christmas break?**
We will work on our own rhythm in the Christmas break.

**What are our goals for the future?**
Our ideal goal is to finish most of the features that is in the backlog.

### 4. Additional notes for the meeting itself

- The current application does not need to change the contrast of the UI.
- The meetings are going well. We can have a shorter meeting.
  If we can discuss everything and show everything that is needed it will be fine.
  So we can keep on distributing the tasks on the Mondays.

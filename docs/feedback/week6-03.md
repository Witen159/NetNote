# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda is excellent.
One addition is that you could assign some people for some agenda points. For example for presenting the app to the TA.
Who should be responsible for that?

Quick Summary: Excellent

Quick Summary: Very Good

The meeting was nicely structured. One thing to improve on is to try involving others in a discussion even more.

But you seem to interact well, and you check in on each other.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

It would be nice if everyone would have some features assigned.

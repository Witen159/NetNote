# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to repository on time.
It followed the template. To further improve you could make it more readable.
Bullet points are not that easily readable. 

Could I also ask you send the agenda to me on mattermost before the meeting :)

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: Notes are complete, but it is slightly difficult to read. Maybe don't structure it by bullet-points.
In terms of tasks, maybe have a separate section for that, and it would be nice if you included task division in a table. 
What task, who is it assigned to, due when?

#### Chair performance

Feedback: The chair went through the agenda and covered all topics in appropriate amount of time.
You were the main person in charge. You asked for everyone's opinions which is incredible.
You could encourage everyone to speak up even more.

You had some nice discussion for Checkstyle.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Very Good

Seems like you assign tasks somewhat equally and there is reflection on this.
If someone wanted more issues, they brought it up.

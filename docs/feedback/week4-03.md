# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to repository on time.
It followed the template. To further improve you could make it even more readable.
Bullet points are not that easily readable. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Sufficient/Good

Feedback: The notes should be an additional section underneath and agenda, they shouldn't override the current agendas. 
The notes are very detailed but hard to read. 

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good / Very Good

I think you did very well in terms of involving the team in discussion, 
but the discussion about the feedback on the size of issues were slightly too long and with a lot of repetitions.
So it would be nice to keep some discussions more concise. The wrapping up of discussions was nice. 

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback: Everyone voiced their ideas, and everyone's comments seemed to be taken into account.
Some discussions seemed too long. 

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback: The team presented a shippable product. They seem to be on track. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: It is nice that all of you completed some of your assigned tasks, however some of you could contribute a bit more, and some a bit less.
It's nice if less experienced members also do more complicated task. I suggest that the more experienced members can take on smaller number of tasks, and maybe focus on doing more intense code reviews and helping others.
